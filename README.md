# Python-Projects
These self_directed projects used a variety of python libraries, including Pandas, Numpy, SMatplotlib, Sea Born, cikit-learn, and many others. 

In 'Price prediction using multiple ML algorythms', I cleaned and transformed a very dirty data set and then used the cleaned data to predict sales price using linear regression, 
knn, random forest and decision tree algorythms to learn about the relationship between the number of features used, and prediction of algorythm of the result of the prediction.
For this data set, decision tree performed the best in terms of how well it predicted usingn the test data set and the relative low rmse compared with other algorythms.

In 'Sales performance analysis-SQL-Python', I downloaded a database containing sales data from 'AdventureWorks' using Microsoft server, then exxxecuted various queries via python.
I then analyzed the data to answer various business questions.  For example, Ii compared sales by different sale person, in different region, product, store sales verse 
online sale.  Sample reports based on these analysis are also included.
