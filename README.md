These self_directed projects is a collection of sample projects using Python or SQL to analyze different types of data to gain business insights.  The main Python libraries used are Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn.

# Python-Projects

In <b>'Price prediction using multiple ML algorythms'</b>, I used Pandas in the Jupyter notebook to cleaned and transformed a very dirty data set and then used the cleaned data to predict sales price using sklearn machine learning algorythms perform linear regression, knn, random forest and decision trees.  

A rigrious analysis was performed for each model to evaluate bias, variance in the data.  Feature selections and hyperparameter tuning was also perormed to improve model performace.  To select the best model for the prediction task, the RMSE error was compared among the models.  

In the end, the linear model has the least error.  Moreover, using normalized data reduced the number of features needed to acieve the same level of acuracy for the linear model.  

# SQL-Projects

In <b>'Sales performance analysis-SQL-Python'</b>, I downloaded a database containing sales data from 'AdventureWorks' using Microsoft server, then issued various queries via python.  I then analyzed the data to answer various business questions.  For example, Ii compared sales by different sale person, in different region, product, store sales verse 
online sale.  Sample reports based on these analysis are also included.
