# Python-Projects
These self_directed projects is a collection of projects to analyze different types of data to gain insights on differnt types of business related issues using data from public domains.  The amin Python libraries used are Pandas, NUmpy, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn.

In 'Price prediction using multiple ML algorythms', I cleaned and transformed a very dirty data set and then used the cleaned data to predict sales price using linear regression, 
knn, random forest and decision tree algorythms to learn about the relationship between the number of features used, and prediction of algorythm of the result of the prediction.
For this data set, decision tree performed the best in terms of how well it predicted usingn the test data set and the relative low rmse compared with other algorythms.

In 'Sales performance analysis-SQL-Python', I downloaded a database containing sales data from 'AdventureWorks' using Microsoft server, then exxxecuted various queries via python.
I then analyzed the data to answer various business questions.  For example, Ii compared sales by different sale person, in different region, product, store sales verse 
online sale.  Sample reports based on these analysis are also included.
