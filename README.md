# Python-Projects
These self_directed projects is a collection of projects to analyze different types of data to gain insights on differnt types of business related issues using data from public domains.  The amin Python libraries used are Pandas, NUmpy, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn.

In <b>'Price prediction using multiple ML algorythms'</b>, I cleaned and transformed a very dirty data set and then used the cleaned data to predict sales price using linear regression, knn, random forest and decision trees.  A rigrious analysis was performed for each model to evaluate bias, variance in the data.  Feature selections and hyperparameter tuning was also perormed to improve model performace.  To select the best model for the prediction task, the RMSE error was compared among the models.  In the end, the linear model has the least error.  Moreover, using normalized data reduced the number of features needed to acieve the same level of acuracy for the linear model.  

In <b>'Sales performance analysis-SQL-Python'</b>, I downloaded a database containing sales data from 'AdventureWorks' using Microsoft server, then issued various queries via python.  I then analyzed the data to answer various business questions.  For example, Ii compared sales by different sale person, in different region, product, store sales verse 
online sale.  Sample reports based on these analysis are also included.
